# Overview of Project

In this challenge, I edited, or refactored, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, I determined whether refactored code successfully made the VBA script run faster.


# Results
2017

In 2017, There is only one loser- the menergy market was strong and many coompanies saw many net profits over 100% - way above market averages!

2018

 In 2018 there is a different story. THe market still has 2 winners (RUN and ENPH) But the other stocks are trening negatively. Without seeing the year before you would thik that the market was in a major downturn, but after seeing the huge gains in the year prior, itsmore likley that the market is beggining to settle 

# Summary
The advantages are clear- time is money, so being able to  refactor code to run faster is of great value, especially when working with large datasets.Refactoring also makes it easier to debug the program. One disadvantage however ( like when editing any code) there is the possiblity of creating errors when there were none before - to prevent this is would be beneficial to save the original copy or be able to recover a previous version.
